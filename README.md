# CHROME-DINO-GAME

Take a quick-look of the project : https://isumanthakur436.github.io/CHROME-DINO-GAME/

This is a clone prototype of the offline chrome dino game, I tried to execute the entire game using only javascript and the very basics of css and html. I used event listeners to indentify specific keyboard keys and functions to perform certain actions and to count score. There are some keyframes implementation also, for running and jumping animation of the dinosaur.
